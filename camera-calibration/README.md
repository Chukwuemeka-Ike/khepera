The files contained in this folder are intended to streamline the calibration of the Khepera robot.

A quick description of the important ones follows.

### calibKhepera.bash
This bash script automates the image capture process by capturing as many photos as are specified in the script.

The more photos are taken, the better the final calibration will be, but only up to a point (left vague here because I don't know what point). To calibrate the initial Khepera I had in my possession, I took 80 images. The subsequent accuracy proved sufficient for preliminary testing.
