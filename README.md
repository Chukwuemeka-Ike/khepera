# khepera
Workspace to develop the tools for the Khepera robot

The Aruco dictionary used by this project is DICT_4X4_50

The tools in this repo employ the OpenCV and ArUco libraries in estimating the pose of a Khepera IV robot with respect to ArUco markers placed throughout the experimental space.

The functionality was developed by Chukwuemeka Ike to aid Ruixuan Yan in his experiments which required that a swarm of robots be able to find their collective centroid.
